# Design Documents

This directory contains design documents for hearthd features and subsystems.

## Purpose

Design documents in this directory serve to:

- Document the design and rationale for major features before implementation
- Provide a reference for understanding architectural decisions
- Facilitate discussion and iteration on feature designs
- Capture requirements, constraints, and trade-offs

## Document Status

Documents may be in various states:
- **Draft**: Initial proposal, under active discussion and iteration
- **Final**: Design has been finalized and approved for implementation
- **Implemented**: Design has been implemented (may contain notes on deviations)

The status should be indicated at the top of each document.
