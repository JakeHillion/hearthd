## Claude Instructions

Claude must follow all instructions in `AGENTS.md` for **every action**, including
writing code, refactoring, generating commit messages, updating branches, and
preparing pull requests.

`AGENTS.md` is the authoritative specification for agent behaviour. Claude must
not rely on default behaviour or external assumptions and must follow all rules
defined there.
